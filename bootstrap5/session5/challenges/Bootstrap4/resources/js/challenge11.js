The staff was friendly and helpful wearing masks and following precautions that made me feel safe to have my family in a hotel during a COVID world. Dinner at the Plaza reminded me of the old NYC with delicious oysters combined with city views with special attention from Yulian, the manager",

            "Jessica B." : "I came to the city to enjoy the scenery we came across the Beirgarten. My friends and I were greeted by great host and an amazing server JACQUELYN. She was very attentive and informative of the overall menu. Hands down amazing service!!",

            "Claire P." : "We stumbled upon the standard hotel and decided to have a few drinks at the beir garten and obviously we had to get food thanks to Cuomo even tho we just wanted to have a few drink... but we are so glad we stayed because our server Jackie was so great, bubbly and knowledgeable with different type of drinks ! Well be back soon thanks again!",

            "Ming Z. " : "The host was very friendly and made us feel welcome. Our server Jackie was very attentive and informative when we had questions about the food and drinks. She was also very bubbly and a made us feel welcome. We enjoyed our night and will be back again",

            "Tim E. " : "Great location and views from the rooms. Booked directly through the website and had no issues--all questions were promptly answered, etc. Bed was comfortable and loved the tub in the bathroom (Deluxe Queen). Not much sound proofing on rooms--easy to hear what was happening next door and in the hallway. Toilet was in a separate room, which was nice, but the close quarters of the room still made it slightly awkward for a romantic couple weekend."

It is well placed, two minutes from a metro line that leads directly to the theater district and the mid-town. Newly built, the hotel favors common areas, which are very pleasant and well appointed. The rooms are a bit small, but very comfortable. The quality of the reception should be noted. The employees are very helpful and give great tips for enjoying New York. A good address",
            
            "Rachel M." : "We stayed at the Yotel for 6 days. It was our first time visiting NYC so we were excited to explore Manhattan. And what a find! The Yotel is very conveniently located, a 5-10 minute walk to Times Square. There’s a Dunkin Donuts nearby, perfect to get breakfast and some coffee on the way. I would also recommend the fantastic Peruvian restaurant which is right around the corner! As for the hotel itself, the rooms are modern and very clean.",

            "Oliver D." : "I stayed as part of Covid19 hotel program and was not able to receive the average guest experience. However I thought that Hotel was beautiful overall. And I would like to return post covid19. To see what the hotel really has to offer.",
            
            "Linda A." : "I stayed here last yr for my 40th bday and my best friends and I stayed here had a great great time! The hotel was very accommodating it was close to everything we were looking for. From shows to Malls we were close by!"

Steps from Times Square and broadway. We had Hamilton tickets and it was literally right out the back door. It’s also pretty close to the 49th Street station which gets you pretty much anywhere else you’d need to go in town. The room seemed to be a pretty good size and was clean.",
            
            "Chris S." : "Stayed here with a bunch of friends for a reunion. The front desk was amazing and the hotel was super clean. The rooms were awesome at a great price. They had a free happy hour in the lobby with alcohol and food. You can’t get any better with the location. It is right in the middle of Times Square. If your going to stay in the city this is the best place to be for the price. Highly recommend!",
            
            "Cindy J." : "Hotel Edison is an unbeatable hotel in NYC. It is close to Times Square, just one block off. Which means that it is just steps away while not having all the crowds of being right on. Additionally, if you go to NYC for the plays, the Hotel Edison is ideally located in the heart of the district. Lastly, being located in the Mid Town area this hotel is in a good spot to get to so many sights in NYC.",
            
            "Beth T." : "Hotel Edison is a gem in the Theatre District within walking distance to most theatres, great restaurants, Times Square, Bryant Park, Central Park, etc. The rooms aren’t fancy, but are very clean and well equipped. It has an attractive lobby with interesting artwork. The restaurant is very nice and has good food and service. The room rates are reasonable. We will definitely stay there again.",
            
            "Mike R." : "Hotel Edison is an amazing place to stay. Everything is walking distance and it easy to grab a cab right in front of the hotel. The security and staff are all professional and always greet you with a smile. We can’t wait for our next vacation at Hotel Edison!"
